# Oiski's Statistical Rain Calculator

## About The Project
This repository is part of the `Oiski.School` namespace collection, which includes projects build as school assignments.

## The program
The assignments states that the following criteria:

**Goal**
>Build a console application that can calculate `minimum` and `maximum` values, as well as an `average` based on the given values a user has provided.

**Input**
>The program must take in the `amount` of values that will be used in the process
>as well as each value (_One by one_) until the `amount` has been reached.
>These values must be stored in an effective way and they must be decimals.

**Output**
>Provide a menu from which a user can navigate the programs functions. \
>Print the provided values in a table like structure and the `minimum`, `maximum` and `average` values underneath.

## Versioning
The Assignment specifies that versioning should be done according to the following template: [_Major_].[_Minor_].[_Path_].
